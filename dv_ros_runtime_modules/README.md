# DV ROS Runtime Modules

This repository provides modules for DV which publishes images / events from the DV Software into ROS.

## Build instructions

The modules are built using ROS catkin build tools. Code was tested ROS Melodic and Noetic releases. Follow these instructions:

1. After building the project, open GV-GUI and disable "Manage local runtime instances" under "Connect to" drop down button:
   ![Disable managed runtime](images/step-4.png)
2. Run `dv-runtime` from a terminal that has ROS environment setup:
```
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.sh
dv-runtime
```
3. Make sure `roscore` is already running.
4. The module binary `.so` files will be available in `/home/user/catkin_ws/devel/lib`, add this path to your DV-GUI search path:
   Click "Add module":
   ![Add module](images/step-7-1.png)
   Click "Modify module search paths":
   ![Modify search path](images/step-7-2.png)
   Click Browse to find the `devel/lib` directory or just paste plain text path using "Add custom" button:
   ![Browse](images/step-7-3.png)
   ![Find correct directory](images/step-7-4.png)
5. The ROS bridge modules should be available in module list and functioning.
